# Data Science Jobs Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to jobs in the field of data science. The analysis aims to provide insights and valuable information about trends, patterns, and characteristics within the dataset.
Additionally, an attempt was made to perform web scraping on a website that provides monthly living costs for each country. A brief analysis of the collected data is also included.
This project is created with a purely didactic purpose, aiming to enhance knowledge and skills in the field of data science and pyspark. The exploration of data science jobs data and web scraping for monthly living costs serve as practical exercises for learning and improving techniques in data analysis.
